/**
 * Metropolis instructions:
 *
 * Here are some instructions for your interview:
 * We will provide you a CSV file consisting of parking data (example: entry/exit times, total price, user ID, site, ID, etc..)
 * We will ask you to read the data into memory and answer questions about the data using the programming language of your choice
 * You can use any IDE or editor of your choice via screen share, and are free to use online resources, libraries, etc.
 * Communicate what youâ€™re building and be open to suggestions and have fun (most important)
 * We will expect you to have a Hello World setup in the environment of your choice ready to go to parse the CSV file. That means having your favorite library/package ready to go for reading CSV files, i.e. we expect that you will already know how to use the library for CSV parsing and will need very little time, if any, looking up how to use it.
